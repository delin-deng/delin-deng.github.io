It is believed that pragmatic competence is a critical ability for communication success. Fraser argued that “it is often not given the emphasis it deserves in the teaching of a second language, with the result that second-language speakers, who lack pragmatic competence, may produce grammatically flawless speech that nonetheless fails to achieve its communicative aims” (Fraser, 2010: 15). I believe that the socio-pragmatic competence entails learning pragmatic and sociolinguistic knowledge, as well as cultural knowledge about how to use language appropriately both linguistically and socially. Consequently, developing socio-pragmatic competence is less about conforming to native conventions but more about understanding why and how these conventions are developed and vary across native speakers. This acquisition could not be fully understood and explained without knowing the learners’ cultural and linguistic backgrounds.
