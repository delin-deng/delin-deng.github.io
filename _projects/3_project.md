Based on data collected with two fields of Chinese communities in Paris and New York, I also explored the question of the linguistic difference between men and women both quantitatively and qualitatively. I investigated the difference between the roles of women and men in Mainland China and the Chinese diaspora in relation to the traditional. I showed that although women are often believed to be innovators of new linguistic uses and lead linguistic change, they are much more conservative than men in the Chinese diaspora in their language use. Women are more attached to tradition, while men adapt more quickly to the culture of the host country. I concluded that the linguistic difference (use of kinship terms and other socio-pragmatic markers) between women and men observed in mainland China and the Chinese diaspora is due to the contrast between the communist system adopted by mainland China and the pre-communist system practiced by the Chinese diaspora. The difference between the role of women and men is the consequence of the divergence in the value of women in these two systems.
