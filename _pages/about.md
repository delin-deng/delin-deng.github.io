I’m a PhD candidate in [linguistics](https://lin.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida, where I'm advised by Prof. [Ratree Wayland](https://slam.lin.ufl.edu/people/ratree-wayland/). I am on schedule to graduate in August 2023 and currently looking for a post-doctoral researcher position. My general research interests are in speech production, speech perception, sound variation, emotional speech recognition, and bilingualism. In my studies, I have used a variety of research methods, including behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational methods. 

I’m currently investigating the [vocal emotions](/projects/1_project/) in American English and Mandarin Chinese, with the goal of unraveling the complexities of the expression and perception of emotions in speech. In addition, I'm interested in [sound variation](/projects/3_project/) in accented Mandarin and am trying to use [deep/machine learning models](/projects/2_project/) to analyze the phonetic variation of fricatives in accented Mandarin.

Trained as a linguist, I combine linguistic theories with experimental and computational methods to study speech and the brain. My works have been published in various [journals and conferences](/publications/).
