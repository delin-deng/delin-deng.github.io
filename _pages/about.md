I am currently a PhD candidate in [linguistics](https://lin.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida, where I work with Professor [Hélène Blondeau](https://languages.ufl.edu/people/faculty-alpha/helene-blondeau/). My specializations include French sociolinguistics, French as a second language, French language variation and change, discourse analysis, and corpus linguistics.

I am currently exploring the acquisition of socio-pragmatic competence by L2 speakers of English and French in global context. By adopting a variationist’s approach, I mainly focus on how speakers’ cultural and linguistic backgrounds influence their language use. Meanwhile, I am also interested in grammaticalization of discourse markers in different varieties of French in Francophone countries.

As a sociolinguist, my research makes use of both observational data and sociolinguistic interviews. I combine both qualitative and quantitative methods in my analysis. My work has been published in a number of peer reviewed journals and international conferences.
