I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Psychology and Human Development](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/academics/departments/psych/) at Vanderbilt University, where I work with Professor [Duane Watson](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/duane-watson). My specializations include French sociolinguistics, French as a second language, French language variation and change, discourse analysis, and corpus linguistics.

I am currently exploring the acquisition of socio-pragmatic competence by L2 speakers of English and French in global context. By adopting a variationist’s approach, I mainly focus on how speakers’ cultural and linguistic backgrounds influence their language use. Meanwhile, I am also interested in grammaticalization of discourse markers in different varieties of French in Francophone countries.

As a sociolinguist, my research makes use of both observational data and sociolinguistic interviews. I combine both qualitative and quantitative methods in my analysis. My work has been published in a number of peer reviewed journals and international conferences.
