I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Psychology and Human Development](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/academics/departments/psych/) at Vanderbilt University, where I work with Professor [Duane Watson](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/duane-watson). My specializations include prosody, computational sociolinguistics, sociophonetics, language variation and change, corpus linguistics and language acquisition.

I am currently examining the speech convergence in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). I mainly focus on the impact of diverse social factors. On the other hand, I investigate the extent to which children with Down syndrome use acoustic cues to mark prominence in speech compared to typically developing children.

As a sociolinguist, my research makes use of both observational, experimental and sociolinguistic interview data. I combine both qualitative and quantitative methods in my analysis. My work has been published in a number of peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.
